# Haskell-SIDH
The goal of this Repo is to provide a novice to ECC the resources to build up their understanding to the point of understanding Supersingular Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman



## Disclaimers <a name="Disclaimers"></a>

 1. I do not own either of the papers in the folder Research and if you are the copyholder of them I will remove them if asked so just pop a message in issues
 2. This is not cryptographically secure please don't use this for any purpose except educational
 3. I don't have any formal qualifications to talk about any of this stuff (yet) so I may be wrong with the finer details





## Todo <a name="Todo"></a>

 - A thorough explanation of all ECC + SIDH in this file (building off https://github.com/RiverNewbury/Python-Elliptic-Curve-Cryptography)
 - Work out why code didn't work with the base points in Wikipedia
 - explanation of how to run the code
 - links to more resources
 - understand then explain Nats and TypeNats
 - Make abs return length and signum return unit vector
